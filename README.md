# Brief2Build

Turn messy client calls into production-ready specs, user stories, and sprint plans in minutes.

## Why this exists
Freelancers and small agencies lose hours translating unstructured discovery calls into actionable engineering docs. Brief2Build ingests transcripts and outputs:
- Product Requirement Document (PRD)
- User stories + acceptance criteria
- Initial architecture outline
- 2-week sprint plan
- Risk checklist and delivery estimate

## Blue Ocean angle
Instead of competing as another generic note-taker, Brief2Build focuses on **post-call execution assets** that directly reduce delivery friction.

## Prototype stack
- Frontend: static HTML/CSS/JS
- API (prototype docs): OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Deploy: GitHub Pages for product demo

## Quick start
Open `index.html` locally.

## Roadmap
- v0: Landing + interactive demo flow
- v1: Real transcript upload + LLM pipeline
- v2: Team workspace + templates by industry
- v3: Integrations (Linear/Jira/Notion)
